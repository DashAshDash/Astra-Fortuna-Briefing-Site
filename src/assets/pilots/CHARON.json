A Frakenstein's monster of scavenged parts and jury-rigged systems, the mech appears as if it dragged itself out of a scrap heap through shear spite and determination. Notably, Charon has done little to correct any of the many, many signs of battle damage the mech has suffered. Bullet holes, beam scoring and blast marks pepper the frame, and most of the paint has long since been worn away by time and weather. Whether Charon has kept these out of indifference, inability to fix them or a grim sense of respect for the fallen comrades who \"donated\" the various parts is uncertain. Despite all this, <em>Borrowed Time</em> remains deadly effective in battle, its edge dulled by neither time nor misfortune. Charon typically mounts a Hunter-Killer nexus, two light nexuses and rounds things out with a thermal lance. This loadout reflects the pilot's preference for remaining at range, attacking enemies from unexpected angles and a reliance on technical expertise and skill over brute force and direct confrontation.</p>","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":13,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":4,"current_overcharge":1,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Tue Aug 23 2022 22:45:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"pre_sniper_pixel.png","cloud_portrait":"https://i.imgur.com/9BQXbNK.png","loadouts":[{"id":"ad75d38f-d026-40bc-b25d-8f0b305188fa","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_technophile_2","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"<span class='horus--subtle'>[time to wake up, child]</span><br>Gained from the <i>Technophile: Rank II</i> pilot talent."},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_stable_structure","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_type_3_projected_shield","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Type-3 Projected Shield traps and denies incoming projectiles by projecting an aggressive, superpositional anti-ballistic barrier."},{"id":"ms_tear_firmament","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Speaker 1 (M.A2.SP1) [Audio, Length: 150:06][Dated 7658U, 35:50] (recovered: GZ Alhambra) [UIBTERMAGANT-TANGENT ROYAL]<br>“Where does it go?
