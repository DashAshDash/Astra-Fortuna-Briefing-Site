It was best guessed by the staff that Sloan was abandoned over their birth defect of only having one arm. Sloan would often be bullied about it by the other kids as they grew up, trying to fight, only to lose constantly. Eventually at age 8 They designed their first prototype arm with scrap found in dumpsters; it was mostly just an iron pole attached to a pulley system that bludgeoned the other kids when they tried to tease them. The staff confiscated the arm, but&nbsp; Sloan quickly learned how to bypass the locking systems for both the staff lounge door and the security chest to get it back. Sloan did in fact teach themselves all they needed to know about hacking, the Omninet and how to really get by using the digital world to their advantage. Once they mastered hacking basic digital wallets Sloan left the orphanage at the age of 10 to set out on their own. They enjoyed a life of various petty crimes: Defacing digital billboards, data theft, trading stolen personal information, Hacking banking accounts. Not to say they were all bad, They found plenty of bullies picking on little&nbsp; guys they took great pleasure in taking down a couple pegs; They would often expose corporate corruption and fraud, break up sex trafficking rings, Outst and Dox crooked cops, and burn through entire sections of the omninet just to put the hurt on rival hackers misusing their talents.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time Sloan was age 13 a case was beginning to stack up against their alias’ as authorities knew a lot of this damage was being done by a minor. However soon they could pursue and try Sloan as an adult due to new laws allowing authorities to try teens as adults for egregious crimes, of which Sloan has commited many. The heat was picking up so Sloan needed a way to lay low. They found the perfect cover; a snooty academy of rich kids learning to be Lancer pilots. It was a simple, if long winded task of hacking themselves in as a student and causing some less than desirable kid to be cut, Sloan was living on a nice chill moon safe and secure. Strangest thing though, Sloan kinda enjoyed the classes. The testing was bullshit, and they&nbsp; hacked in passable scores, but the lessons on mech tactics and lectures describing great battles we, in particular Sloan actually kept from sleeping through “A History of Cyberwarfare”. Sloan actually found a few&nbsp; half decent people to hang out with and decided to stick around even after the heat died down.&nbsp;</p><p>Sloan enjoyed taking the piss out of the other jerks at the academy, always finding fun ways to expose their Omninet searches to friends and faculty, causing asshole teacher’s lectures to show embarrassing private photos of themselves, and constantly running circles around campus security and IT for almost 6 years straight. The strange thing that kept Sloan around was actually finding some nice friends for once, people who weren’t just sketchy hackers that might backhack you or sell you out. Honorable and kind people rather. Being a Lancer Pilot, rather than a criminal… sounds worth it when you get to work with real heroes like these.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":7,"background":"Hacker","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"b23b179b-b0fd-46a4-b94e-6ac11676e8f3","name":"The Phisherman 2.0","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_goblin","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":5,"boost":0,"current_hp":9,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":2,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Tue Aug 02 2022 18:36:57 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://i.imgur.com/2lRJhQy.jpg","loadouts":[{"id":"981d616c-74e7-4aa7-aec3-3673c97ccc9b","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_h0r_os_system_upgrade_i","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_comp_con_class_assistant_unit","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Companion/Concierge-Class Assistant Unit conforms to all galaxy-wide standards.
